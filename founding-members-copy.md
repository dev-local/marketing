###Bio.

I love art, the web, words and bringing it all together. I'm a doer, an organizer and I have a passion for what's next. I run Flower Press Creative Studio, LLC, a Seattle-based creative studio offering comprehensive services in the areas of Brand Identity, UI/UX, Visual Design, Development and Print. Our work products take the form of Responsive Websites, Mobile Applications, Ad Campaigns and Supporting Creative Materials for the brands we serve. Our clients range from some of the world's most well recognized and trusted brands to tiny companies just starting out.

We have a collaborative environment that includes designers and engineers with diverse backgrounds. We work with a virtual team model that strengthens our reach. For more information visit our site: www.theflowerpress.net.

My early professional experience includes work in marketing and brand strategy. I have held full-time positions in both copywriting and design for companies and agencies including: Nike, Jackson & Perkins, Harry and David, and the Trada Group in San Francisco. I hold a BS in Advertising from the University of Oregon. For more information on my background visit: www.linkedin.com/in/khaiersta/
