Blurb: SeedCode is the leading extensions developer for FileMaker Pro, the cross platform database and app creation environment from Apple. Our award winning calendar, mapping, and sync apps help developers add sophisticated interfaces to their projects. We're taking those 10 years of calendar experience and launching out first mainstream calendar app: a *very* early build is at http://www.dayback.com
DayBack provides a new interface for Google Calendar (and soon for other data sources as well)--an interface that borrows metaphors from project management, not from the agricultural past informing most calendar designs. We then put a database behind it so you can tag, link, and *work* with your events. DayBack transforms your calendar from an appointment book to a planning tool.

We don't work like 19th century farmers, so don't use their calendar to plan your life. DayBack takes calendars out of the preindustrial past and let's you carve out time to accomplish what's most important. Life can be something that happens to you, but it doesn't have to be. You may be surprised at what happens when you realize you've got time. It's time for a radically new calendar.

Somewhat stiff bio (let me know if you’d like me to re-work it):

I'm the Director of UI Engineering at Intridea, a firm believer that every problem, no matter how dire the situation, has a path to success, and am always chasing the rush of a great solution. Over the past 4 years as lead front-end dev, I've found myself working with complex applications supporting a diverse range of users and browsers. I am a strong advocate for good user experience and using the right tool for the job.

Corengi is helping to connect patients with clinical trials that are right for them.  Initially in type 2 diabetes, we've been funded by the NIH to expand into a number of other diseases and are working directly with pharmaceutical companies to help patients find research studies that meet their needs.

Hi Emma,

Yes, I'd of course love to be included in the Founding Members section!  Here's a quick bio/summary of what I'm working on:

-----------

I'm Jen Pierce, and I'm a developer at YouGov (http://www.yougov.com), a UK-based market research company.  

I work on a data visualization web app called BrandIndex (http://www.brandindex.com), which tracks public opinion of consumer brands.  It's a CherryPy app with a Mongo backend, and I spend most of my day in Python and/or Javascript.  Recently I've also been experimenting with mobile app development with Kivy, a cross-platform, open source Python library for rapid application development.  It's great!  

I have a design background, & in my off time I'm usually working on freelance design projects and/or various crafty pursuits, including knitting, spinning, and gardening.  Someday I plan to move to the country and start an alpaca farm.  If you want to talk shop about Python, front end development, or alpacas, feel free to get in touch!

Hi Emma,

My apologies for waiting until the last possible second to respond. I’m out (on vacay!) next week, so I’ll miss the photo shoot. I’ll try to find a good one to send along. (Deadline for the photo?)

Here’s a little blurb about me:

--
Hi! I’m a recent Seattle transplant (from San Francisco, Chicago, and originally Peaks Island, Maine). I am a software engineer with a focus on NLP and machine learning for a Bay Area startup called Reverb that launched an iPad app in December. We are working to bring our slick content discovery experience to iOS and Android in the coming months. When I’m not coding in Scala or Python, I enjoy drinking hoppy beers, throwing (and catching) frisbees, and chilling with my wife and 2-year-old daughter. I feel fortunate to be co-working at DevLocal and I look forward to more great folks joining the community.

If this differs wildly in terms of length from the other blurbs you’ve received, please let me know. Or if you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free.

Best,
Robert  robert.voyer@gmail.com
